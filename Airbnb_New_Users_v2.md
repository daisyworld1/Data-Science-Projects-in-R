Introduction
------------

Airbnb is an online market place for home rentals. It was founded in 2008, since then, it has had exponential growth. Airbnb has become a serious competitor and a threat to the hotel industry. 

You can find Airbnb listings in most cities and countries in different styles and price points. When it first started, people use it for personal travel to save money or when no hotel rooms are available. Nowadays, people still use it for that purpose, but more importantly, a lot of people see it as the first choice, because it has what hotels can't offer - a sense of home.

The goal of this analysis is to provide insights into Airbnb's new user base. The data was originally posted by Airbnb for Kaggle Competition in 2015. Even if it is three years old, it provides insights into Airbnb user profiles and destination preference at the time.

Let's take a quick look at the data. What important fields are available to us to analyze?

``` r
names(train_user)
```

    ##  [1] "id"                      "date_account_created"   
    ##  [3] "timestamp_first_active"  "date_first_booking"     
    ##  [5] "gender"                  "age"                    
    ##  [7] "signup_method"           "signup_flow"            
    ##  [9] "language"                "affiliate_channel"      
    ## [11] "affiliate_provider"      "first_affiliate_tracked"
    ## [13] "signup_app"              "first_device_type"      
    ## [15] "first_browser"           "country_destination"

Age and gender can be important contributing factors to the country someone decides to travel to. One of the other two categories is the time related: timestamp_first_active and date_first_booking. The two attributes may not be very useful if we analyze each one by itself. It can be if we find the difference between the two and create a new attribute time\_diff, which captures the number of days it takes for someone to make their first reservation after they first signed up as a user. The next group of attribute is related to users choice of technology: signup_app, signup_method, affiliate_provider, first_browser, etc. These can be useful for marketing team for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing dollars. The last attribute I want to mention is language. Most users preferred language is English; however, for those whose primary language is not English, we can decide whether it has any relationship with the primary language of the country destination.

We must know that there are limitations to our dataset. 

1.  We do not know how many guests are traveling with the person making the booking. We do not know the gender and age of those guests. 
2. There are a lot of missing data for important attributes such as age and gender, which lead to varying sample sizes and predictability. 
3. We can only determine the correlation not the causation the country destination. If the number of booking is low in a certain area, it could be due to the lack of supply in the country or the low quality of listings in the country.

Data Wrangling
--------------

In order to prepare the dataset for analysis, I have cleaned and wrangled the dataset. The process is described in detail below.
In the age attribute, there are a lot of numbers that fell out of a reasonable range. Many people have entered their year of birth instead of age. For those instances, I have calculated their ages in the year of 2015. Additionally, to make it easier to analyze, I placed different ages in groups.

``` r
age_cat <- as.numeric(train_user$age)
train_user$age_cat [is.na(age_cat)] <- -1
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >1000, 2015 - age_cat, age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >65 & age_cat < 1000,"over 65", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >55 & age_cat <= 65 ,"from 56 to 65", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >45 & age_cat <= 55 ,"from 46 to 55", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >35 & age_cat <= 45 ,"from 36 to 45", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >25 & age_cat <= 35 ,"from 26 to 35", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat >18 & age_cat <= 25 ,"from 18 to 25", age_cat)
train_user$age_cat  <- ifelse(age_cat > 0 & age_cat <= 18,"below 18", age_cat)

train_user$age_cat <- as.character(train_user$age_cat)
train_user$age_cat <- ifelse(train_user$age_cat == 7, "below 18", train_user$age_cat)
train_user$age_cat <- ifelse(train_user$age_cat == -1, "-unknown-", train_user$age_cat)
```

Now that we have categorized ages, it becomes easier to combine with gender and create a new variable to analyze: age\_gender.

``` r
train_user$gender_age = as.character(paste(train_user$gender, train_user$age_cat))
```

Next, we can take a look at users' choice of technology. There are two main types of technology: browser type and device type. We are going to simplify that by lumping rarely used types in one category - others.

Browser type:

``` r
browser_type <- as.character(train_user$first_browser)

unique_browser <- train_user %>% 
  group_by(first_browser) %>% 
  tally()
arrange(unique_browser,desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 52 x 2
    ##    first_browser       n
    ##    <fct>           <int>
    ##  1 Chrome          63845
    ##  2 Safari          45169
    ##  3 Firefox         33655
    ##  4 -unknown-       27266
    ##  5 IE              21068
    ##  6 Mobile Safari   19274
    ##  7 Chrome Mobile    1270
    ##  8 Android Browser   851
    ##  9 AOL Explorer      245
    ## 10 Opera             188
    ## # ... with 42 more rows

``` r
sum(unique_browser$n)
```

    ## [1] 213451

``` r
browser_table <-  data_frame(
  first_browser = c("Chrome","Chrome Mobile", "Safari", "Safari Mobile", "Firefox", "IE"),
  browser_type = c("Chrome","Chrome","Safari","Safari","Firefox", "IE"))

train_user <- left_join(train_user, browser_table, by = "first_browser", copy = "browser_table")
```

    ## Warning: Column `first_browser` joining factor and character vector,
    ## coercing into character vector

``` r
train_user$browser_type[is.na(train_user$browser_type)] <- "others"
```

Device type:

``` r
device_type <- train_user %>% 
  group_by(first_device_type) %>% 
  tally()
arrange(device_type,desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 2
    ##   first_device_type      n
    ##   <fct>              <int>
    ## 1 Mac Desktop        89600
    ## 2 Windows Desktop    72716
    ## 3 iPhone             20759
    ## 4 iPad               14339
    ## 5 Other/Unknown      10667
    ## 6 Android Phone       2803
    ## 7 Android Tablet      1292
    ## 8 Desktop (Other)     1199
    ## 9 SmartPhone (Other)    76

``` r
sum(device_type$n)
```

    ## [1] 213451

``` r
device_table <-  data_frame(
  first_device_type = c("Mac Desktop","Windows Desktop", "iPhone", "iPad" , "Android Phone", "Android Tablet ","Desktop (Other)","SmartPhone (Other)"),
  device_type = c("Desktop","Desktop","Portable","Portable","Portable", "Portable","Desktop","Portable"))

train_user <- left_join(train_user, device_table, by = "first_device_type", copy = "device_table")
```

    ## Warning: Column `first_device_type` joining factor and character vector,
    ## coercing into character vector

``` r
train_user$device_type[is.na(train_user$device_type)] <- "others"
```

In the language column, language codes were stored instead of full language names. I added a column to show the full name of these languages.

``` r
language_code <- read.csv(file="language_code.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")
train_user <- left_join(train_user, language_code, by = "language", copy = "language_code")
```

    ## Warning: Column `language` joining factors with different levels, coercing
    ## to character vector

We can potentially examine the relationship between the primary language of a user and the primary language of a country destination; thereby, a new attribute (destination_language) that represents the primary language of the country_destination is added to the train\_user table.

``` r
destination_language <-  data_frame(
  country_destination = c("US", "FR", "IT", "GB", "ES", "CA", "DE", "NL", "AU","PT"),
  country_primary_language = c("English", "French", "Italian", "English", "Spanish", "English", "German", "Dutch", "English","Portuguese"))

train_user <- left_join(train_user, destination_language, by = "country_destination", copy = "destination_language")
```

    ## Warning: Column `country_destination` joining factor and character vector,
    ## coercing into character vector

``` r
train_user$country_primary_language [is.na(train_user$country_primary_language)] <- "others"
```

We will create a new variable that combines the primary language of a user and the primary language of a country destination to see if there's a link between the two.

``` r
train_user$language_combo = as.factor(paste(train_user$language_full,"-", train_user$country_primary_language))
```

Last but not least, the difference between date\_account\_created and date\_first\_booking is created as a new attribute to examine how long it will take someone to make a booking after they first sign up.

``` r
train_user$time_diff <- as.Date(train_user$date_first_booking,"%Y-%m-%d") - as.Date(train_user$date_account_created,"%Y-%m-%d")
```

Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

Because of the unique characteristics of the data, I will split the analysis into two sections. 

First, I will analyze all the data that are available globally.

Second, I will parse out data for international country_destination as they consist of a much smaller percentage of the bookings.

I will create plots using important attributes discussed previously.

The first attribute I will look at is age. Since I donâ€™t have clean data for the age attribute we will create a subset of age to only include someone whose age is between 18 to 65. Then, we will take a look at the summary of the age attribute to get a general sense of the data.

###  Global

#### Age Summary - Global

``` r
train <- read_csv2("train_user_clean.csv")
```

    ## Using ',' as decimal and '.' as grouping mark. Use read_delim() for more control.

    ## Warning: Missing column names filled in: 'X1' [1]

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   X1 = col_integer(),
    ##   date_account_created = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   timestamp_first_active = col_double(),
    ##   date_first_booking = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   age = col_integer(),
    ##   signup_flow = col_integer(),
    ##   time_diff = col_integer()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
train1 <- train %>% filter(age > 18 & age <= 65)
summary(train1$age)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##   19.00   28.00   33.00   35.71   41.00   65.00

#### Age Plot - Global

``` r
ggplot(train1, aes(x = age, fill = country_destination)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "stack") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train1-2-1.png)

The Age of guests and the number of bookings made on Airbnb appear to be a right skewed distribution. After filtering out guests who are younger than 18 years old or older than 99 years old, the mean age is 36.6, and the median age is 34. It has a first quartile of 28 years old and a 3rd quartile of 42 years old. The majority of new usersâ€™ ages fall between late twenties and early forties. As people get older, they are less likely to make reservations on Airbnb. There is a small peak  around age 18 and 19. Regardless of age, traveling within in the US is the top choice.

### Time - Global

We have two important time-related attributes - timestamp\_first\_active and date\_first\_booking. We are not considering date_account_created because this is the same date as timestamp\_first\_active. I created a column time_diff to show the number of days for a user to make the first reservation after the date they are first active on Airbnb. Youâ€™ll find that more than 50% of users make their first booking in the first three days. This graph appears to be a Poisson distribution. As time goes by, it is much less likely for someone to make a reservation on Airbnb.

``` r
train3 <- train %>% filter(time_diff >= 0)
ggplot(train3, aes(x = time_diff, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "stack") + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,30)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train3-1-1.png)

This graph appears to be a Poisson distribution. As time goes by, it is much less likely for someone to make a reservation on Airbnb.

### Language - Global

The next attribute I want to explore is the language preference of a new user. English is chosen by more than 97% users to display on Airbnb. This doesnâ€™t mean it is the primary language spoken by Airbnb users.

Chinese is the second most used language on Airbnb. The third and fourth languages chosen are French and Spanish

For those people who did choose other languages to display may give us some more knowledge on the ethnicity or the country of origin of Airbnb users. Chinese is the second most used language on Airbnb. At the same time, top destination for these Chinese users is others, which means the destination countries they chose are not US or popular European counties.
The third and fourth language chosen are French and Spanish. And both groups of users preferred countries that have English as their primary language. If we dig deeper in their second choice of country destination. These second choices tend to have a primary language that is the same as the user's language. This is true for French, German and Italian users. We don't know if this is the case for Chineses or Spanish users; however, they second most preferred destination is others, which could indicate a country with the same spoken language as the userâ€™s.

``` r
train4 <- train1 %>% filter(country_destination != "NDF")
language_combo1 <- train4 %>% 
  group_by(language_combo) %>% 
  tally()
display_language_combo1 <- arrange(language_combo1,desc(n))
print(display_language_combo1,n=30)
```

    ## # A tibble: 105 x 2
    ##    language_combo                   n
    ##    <chr>                        <int>

    ## # ... with 13 more rows

### Outside of US

Now, we will take a look at oversea destinations. What are the characteristics of people who made reservations outside of the US?

France is the most popular destination followed by Italy and Great Britain.

``` r
train2 <- train1 %>% filter(country_destination != "US" & country_destination!= "NDF" & country_destination != "other")
ggplot(train2,aes(x = age, fill = country_destination)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "stack") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-1-1.png)

Outside of the US, France is the most popular destination followed by Italy and Great Britain.

``` r
ggplot(train2,aes(x = age, fill = country_destination)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "fill") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-2-1.png)

Country preferences appear fairly consistent among different ages.

#### Age Category - Outside of US

What if we put age into five different buckets, will that show us a clearer picture?

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = age_cat , fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-3-1.png)

Spain is more popular among younger users; the opposite is true for Great Britain. Canada is more popular among middle-aged users.

### Gender - Outside of US

Letâ€™s take a look at gender. Which gender is represent a higher percentage of users who made their first bookings on Airbnb?

``` r
train2_1 <- train2 %>% filter((gender == "FEMALE" | gender == "MALE") & (gender_age != "FEMALE below 18" & gender_age != "MALE below 18" & gender_age != "FEMALE over 65" & gender_age != "MALE over 65" ))
ggplot(train2_1, aes(x = gender, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar() +  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2_1-1-1.png)

There are more female users than male users. It appears that female users have a much stronger preference for France. 

#### Age & Gender - Outside of US

What if we combine age category and gender to create a new variable gender_age, will that provide us some unique insights?

``` r
ggplot(train2_1, aes(x = gender_age, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2_1-2-1.png)

Both female and male are less likely to travel to Spain as they age, males show a stronger correlation. Both females and males are more likely to travel to Great Britain as they get older, females show a stronger correlation.

#### The Big Picture - Age & Gender - Outside of US

``` r
ggplot(train2_1 , aes(x = gender, y = age)) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.35 ) + facet_wrap(~country_destination)
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2_1-3-1.png)

This facet grid reaffirmed us of our previous analysis. It does provide us additional information. The travel age for males is slight high than the travel age for female. This tendency appears strong in Great Britain, Germany, and France. 

### Choice of Technology (Device, Browser, OS) - Outside of US

After exploring age and gender, we can take a look at devise type, browser type, and signup methods. Do people use different browser type have different preference? 

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = device_type, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-1.png)

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = device_type, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "stack") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-2.png)

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = browser_type, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-3.png)

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = browser_type, fill = country_destination)) +
geom_bar(position = "stack") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-4.png)

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = signup_app, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-5.png)

``` r
ggplot(train2, aes(x = signup_app, fill = country_destination)) + geom_bar(position = "stack") + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")
```

![](Airbnb_new_users_v2_files/figure-markdown_github/train2-4-6.png)

It does not seem like thereâ€™s a strong correlation between device type / signup\_app / browser type and country destination. Android users does show different proportion of country of destination; however, since the total number of users is not statistically significant.

Machine Learning
----------------

### Logistic Regression

Before make the prediction, we need to have a new dataset that's suitable for the logistic regression model. We will remove any observations with missing values and only keep the attributes that are relevant to predicting the country_destination.
By using logistic regression, we can find relationships between two variable where the predicted variable is binomial while holding other variables constant. In this case, I will explore the relationship between gender and the country_destination.

``` r
train_lr <- data.frame(as.numeric(train$age), as.factor(train$gender),as.factor(train$language_full),train$country_destination)
colnames(train_lr) <- c("age", "gender", "language", "country_destination")
train_lr <- train_lr %>% filter(age > 18 & age <= 65)
booked <- as.character(train_lr$country_destination)
booked_US <- as.character(train_lr$country_destination)
train_lr$booked <- booked <- as.numeric(ifelse(train_lr$country_destination=="NDF",1,0))
train_lr$booked_US <- booked_US <- as.numeric(ifelse(train_lr$country_destination=="US",1,0))
```

What is the relationship between gender and whether someone booked any reservations?

``` r
ctry.out <- glm(booked~age+gender,
                data=train_lr, family="binomial")
coef(summary(ctry.out))
```

This logistic regression result tells us that when someone chose a gender, either Male or Female, they are 20% more likely to book a reservation regardless of country. If someone selected other or -unknown- gender, they are at least 10% more likely to make a reservation in the US. This method has a lot of limitations in terms of predicting a country, we can only have one categorical variable, and the dependent variable must be a boolean variable; however, further analysis can be done by swapping the variables in the expand.grid function to find outcomes for different input variables. 
Because of the limitation of the way variables can be used in the logistic regression model,  I will attempt to use random forest to make predictions.


### Decision Tree

In this model, Iâ€™ll create a subset of the `train` dataset and split the data into a training set and a testing set, then I'll create a decision three, and I'll compare the result between the predicted results and the actual results.


``` r
train6 <- cbind.data.frame(train$age_cat,train$gender,train$language_full, train$country_destination,train$device_type, train$browser_type)
colnames(train6) <- c("age_cat", "gender","language_full",  "country_destination", "device_type","browser_type" )
train6 <- na.omit(train6)
split <- sample.split(train6$country_destination, SplitRatio = 0.7)
testing <- subset(train6, split == FALSE)
training <- subset(train6, split == TRUE)
```

``` r
trainTree <- rpart(country_destination ~ gender + age_cat + language_full + device_type + browser_type, data=training, method="class", control=rpart.control(minbucket=1000))
prp(trainTree)
```

``` r
PredictCART <- predict(trainTree, newdata=testing, type="class")
table(testing$country_destination,PredictCART)
```

As you can see from the decision tree, the model is only able to predict two outcomes.  This could mean that regardless of age and gender US is the most preferred country_destination. The model predicted the country_destination correctly 60% of the time. 

### Conclusion

In 2015, Airbnb was a young company looking to find its path in the global economy. Data science has helped pave the way for Airbnb to become a more mature company with increasing global impact.

In 2015, I would have made the following suggestion based on the analysis I've done in this project:

1. Focus on EU bookings. There are a lot of potential for growth there as they are popular tourist destinations for US guests. US and EU share similar culture which makes EU a perfect market for Airbnb to replicate its success in the US.

2. Focus on China. Chinese is the second most used language by Airbnb users, which signifies the popularity of Airbnb among Chinese users. As China's economy continues to grow and Chinese citizens become increasing wealthy and more accustomed to the sharing economy. There's a huge business opportunity to expand business there before local competition monopolizing the market.

3. Continue to put an effort on strengthening the US bookings while also making suggestion in popular European destination when someone chose English as their primary language. If language chosen is not English, make suggestion in countries using the same language as the user in additional to US listings.

As Airbnb increase its user base and collect more relevant search result, more meaningful and accurate prediction will be possible.
